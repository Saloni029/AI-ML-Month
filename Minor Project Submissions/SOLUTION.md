1.
Quantitative variables=Data with numerical variables are considered quantitative data (e.g. how many; how much; or how often)
Example-In honey production dataset numcol, yieldpercol, totalprod, stocks, priceperlb, prodvalue are quantitative variables.

Qualitative variables=Qualitative data are data about categorical variables (e.g. what type). 
They may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code.
Example-In honey production dataset, state is the qualitative variables.

2. From correlation graph of numcol one can infer that as number of colonies increases production value also increases over the year. 
In case of yieldpercol, one can infer that most of the production value of yield ranges from 40 to 100.
In case of 


3.There is no state named as "US" in the dataset


7. From the last second graph you can clear see that production value is decreasing and from last graph you can infer that total production is the cause for its declining followed by stocks.
